    <h2>Colonel</h2>
    <p>
        Colonel was once an ordinary chicken stationed at The Farm until <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde</a> found her and subsequently named her Colonel. Colonel was vital to <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde's</a> team, as she was able to distract the Cabal long enough for <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde's</a> to sneak up on and assassinate them. Colonel managed to survive the liberation of the Last City and was returned to the Farm. During The Dawning 2017, <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde</a> gave her a cape and a horn to make her more like him and he often visited the Farm during his spare time to talk to, feed, and pet Colonel along with the other chicken residents of the farm until his murder at the hands of Uldren Sov. Following this event, Colonel was relocated to the new Tower, taking up residence at <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde's</a> former workstation in the Hangar. The Colonel was named amongst <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde's</a> possessions in his will. While repairing the Ace of Spades, The Guardian comes across a message meant for Suraya Hawthorne in the (extremely unlikely) event that she does kill <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde</a>, she would gain ownership of Colonel. As of Lightfall, she is still in the hangar, with another chicken roaming around the <a href="Cayde.html">Cayde-6</a> memorial being mistaken by players as the Colonel.

        Almost two years after <a href="Cayde.html">CaydeÂ´s</a> death, Saint-14 anointed the chicken as "Pigeon Lord".
