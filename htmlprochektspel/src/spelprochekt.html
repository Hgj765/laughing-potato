    <p>The Traveler is a mysterious spherical paracausal entity associated with the Light.
        Massive in scale, it hangs motionless in the skies above the Last City built in its shadow.
        Once responsible for terraforming the worlds of the Sol System, it was rendered largely inactive during the Collapse,
        when its ancient enemy arrived and launched a devastating assault on human civilization. </p>
