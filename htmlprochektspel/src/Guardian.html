    <h2 id="Primary">Primary weapons</h2>
    <p>
        Primary weapons are all-purpose weapons for most combat scenarios. Primary ammo is easy to come by and is stored in large quantities, so players will find themselves relying on these weapons the most.

        Auto Rifle - fully automatic weapons capable of engaging multiple enemies at close-mid range, but require recoil control to use at longer distances.
        Hand Cannon - double-action handguns with high impact and stopping power. Rewards a steady hand.
        Pulse Rifle - burst fire, mid-range weapons with moderate recoil.
        Scout Rifle -semi-auto precision weapons meant for long-range engagements.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="bakgrund">
    <h2 id="Special">Special weapons</h2>
    <p>

        Special weapons are more situational than primary weapons, filling specific niches. They are useful for tackling high-priority targets, or for backup in case a primary runs dry. Special ammo appears less often, and players cannot store as much special ammo.

        Fusion Rifle - medium-range, high-impact weapons that require the user to charge before firing. Fires bolts in groups of seven.
        Shotgun - close-range firearms that provide immediate conflict resolution. Rewards aggressive play.
        Sniper Rifle - long-range weaponry meant for causing high spikes of damage on their targets.
        Sidearm - semi-automatic pistols with high ammo reserves. Meant for taking out low-health targets in a pinch
    </p>
</div>
<div class="bakgrund">
    <h2 id="Heavy">Heavy weapons</h2>
    <p>

        Heavy weapons are the most powerful weapon a player can carry. They are great for dealing lots of damage against powerful targets, or for dispersing large swarms of enemies. Heavy ammo appears the least and players can only carry a limited reserve, so heavy weapon use is generally reserved for more difficult encounters.

        Machine Gun - heavy-duty firearms built for suppression of hostile forces due to large magazine sizes and ammo reserves, good damage, and decent accuracy, even at long range.
        Rocket Launcher - shoulder-mounted weapon systems that fire an explosive projectile that detonates upon impact.
        Sword - melee weapons meant for dealing high damage against single targets at close range.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="bakgrund">
    <h2 id="Melee">Melee</h2>
    <p>

        Melee weapons and grenades fall under Guardian abilities, rather than collectible weapons.

        Hunter Knife - Throwing Knife (Gunslinger), Blink Strike (Bladedancer), Smoke (Nightstalker)
        Warlock - Melee-Scorch (Sunsinger), Energy Drain (Voidwalker), Thunderstrike (Stormcaller)
        Titan - Melee-Storm Fist (Striker), Disintegrate (Defender), Sunstrike (Sunbreaker)
