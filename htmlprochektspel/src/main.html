        The light is the power, grated by the traveler to the guardians making them imortal and giving them spesial abilities.<br>
        The dark is the counter part of the light, granted by the travelers brother "the veil" and works more or less the same as the light.

    <h2 id="traveler"> The Traveler</h2>
    <p>The Traveler is a mysterious spherical paracausal entity associated with the Light.
        Massive in scale, it hangs motionless in the skies above the Last City built in its shadow.
        Once responsible for terraforming the worlds of the Sol System, it was rendered largely inactive during the Collapse,
        when its ancient enemy arrived and launched a devastating assault on human civilization. </p>
